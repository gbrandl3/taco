			xdevmenu README file
			====================
			 by Andy Gotz (12/10/99)

This README file describes briefly how to compile and run xdevmenu.

xdevmenu is a generic graphical program which can be used to execute
commands on TACO device objects in a TACO control system (cf. http:
//www.esrf.fr/computing/cs/taco/taco.html).

This source code release contains all the source code needed to compile 
and run xdevmenu except the Motif libraries. xdevmenu uses the Motif 1.2
set of widgets and needs a Motif development kit. The present release
uses the Lesstiff Motif widget implementation which is a free implementation
of Motif (cf. http://www.lesstiff.org). 

The present distirbution has been tailored and tested on Linux only for
the moment (the code was originally developed for HP-UX and Solaris however).

COMPILING
---------

To compile on Linux do the following :

1. modify the src/Makefile to point to the correct Motif 1.2 and X11 paths
   (presently set to /usr/local/Lesstiff/Motif1.2 and /usr/X11R6/)

2. set DSHOME to your TACO dserver home directory e.g. ~dserver

3. type make all in the root directory (this will make and install the
   libraries ascapi and tcapi and make xdevmenu

RUNNING
-------

To run xdevmenu do the following :

1. copy bitmaps/* to /usr/X11/bitmaps

2. set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the dserver + Motif library paths
   (e.g. setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~dserver/lib/linux/x86:/usr/local/Lesstif/Motif1.2/lib)

3. set NETHOST to your favourite TACO control system (e.g. setenv NETHOST libra)

4. set XAPPLRESDIR to app-defaults (e.g. setenv XAPPLRESDIR ./app-defaults)

5. type ./src/xdevmenu and have fun !

BUGS
----

1. minor problem with Lesstif and the graphical window displaying the device
   icons occurrs sometimes which clicking on the icon - the label moves to
   the left of the gear button

2. an error message is displayed when releasing a device but it works nonetheless !

What is TACO lite ? TACO lite is the ability to run TACO servers and clients without 
the database.  Normally TACO needs a database (ndbm, mySQL, or SQLITE) for storing 
network address and permanent configuration information and settings. Sometimes 
however all you want is a single device server and client running and using the TACO 
protocol. 

For example in a small lab or for an embedded or portable device. In this case it can 
be a constraint to run the manager, database and message server as well. Running a 
device server without the database means you have to fix the network address (host and 
program number) for the server and inform the client, somehow tell the server which 
devices it has to serve and program the server not to use the resources in the database 

To use TACO lite all you have to do is :

-# on the server side start the device server as follows
\verbatim
MyServer name -nodb -pn 123456 -device mydevice1 mydevice2 ... 
\endverbatim
where name is the personal name of the device server,123456 is the program
number the device server will use and mydevice1, mydevice2, ... are 
the names of the device to be served (note they do not have to have to respect the 
domain/family/member nomenclature).

\note make sure this is free beforehand by doing a rcpinfo -p host on the host where it will run

-# on the client side import the device(s) in the device server using the following
syntax for the name
\verbatim
//host/mydevice1?123456 
\endverbatim
where host is the name of the host machine where the client is running, mydevice1 
is the name of the device given on the command line to the server, and 123456 is the 
program number specified on the command line of the server.

Clients can mix devices without database with devices with database in the same 
process. Using TACO lite it is now possible to distribute servers and clients as 
static binaries to run on green sites where TACO is not installed. This is just 
the first version of running TACO servers and clients without a database. Comments 
are welcomed. Further evolutions could include providing support for a flat file for 
resources for example.

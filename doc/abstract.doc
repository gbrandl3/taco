TACO is a toolkit for implementing distributed object oriented control systems. It
has been used at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble
(FRANCE) to control the accelerator complex and all beamlines.

It is also used at
<a href="http://www.frm2.tum.de/">Neue Forschungsneutronenquelle "Heinz Maier-Leibnitz" (FRM II)</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://www.frm2.tum.de/})\endlatexonly
in Garching (Germany) to control the instruments and at the
<a href="http://www.hartrao.ac.za">Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO)</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://www.hartrao.ac.za/})\endlatexonly
in Hartebeesthoek (South Africa) to control a 26 meter radio telescope.

TACO can be compared to other distributed object toolkits like CORBA, DCOM, and OPC
(on Windows) with the main differences being :

-# TACO is easy to use and understand,
-# TACO is freely available,
-# TACO is based on ONC/RPC (now part of the GNU C library),
-# TACO is multi-platform.

In TACO all control points are represented as devices. Devices are objects which belong
to a control class. The class implements the logic necessary to control the device
hardware/software.

Devices are served by processes called device servers. Device servers are distributed
over one or any number of machines.

Clients which need to accesses devices do so through a application programmer's interface.
The clients can access devices synchronously, asynchronously or by events.

The network layers are kept entirely hidden from the device server and client programmer's by

TACO. TACO supports a database for storing persistant information and keeping track of where
devices are running.

TACO is used to control an accelerator complex, experimental setups on beamlines (using
synchrotron radiation and neutrons), a radio telescope, and other smaller projects.
It is ideal for adding Ethernet control to embedded and non-embedded devices in a research,
industrial or home environment.

Refer to the appendix for a list of existing device servers.

TACO can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://taco.sourceforge.net">TACO website</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://taco.sourceforge.net})\endlatexonly
and installed from the source code. TACO is made available under the GNU Public Licence
(see \ref license) without warranties. For news about recent developments in TACO go to the

How to get started with TACO ?
The best way is to download it and install it 
first. Once it is compiled for your platform start the TACO manager and database 
servers. Start a test device server and client to see if everything is working. 
The final step is to write your own device server for your hardware and own 
client for your application and start them. Voila you have a working TACO control 
system! 

Here is a step by step description of the above recipe :

-# downloading - TACO can be downloaded from 
   the 
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38710&package_id=30925">TACO download site</a>.
   \latexonly 
   TACO download site (see {\tt http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=38710\&package\_id=30925})
   \endlatexonly
   The source files are taco-@VERSION@.tar.gz or taco-@VERSION@.tar.bz2. 
-# unpacking - unpack the source code in a directory where you have sufficient 
   free space for compiling using tar e.g.
\verbatim
tar -xzvf taco-@VERSION@.tar.gz
\endverbatim
   or
\verbatim
tar -zjvf taco-@VERSION@.tar.gz
\endverbatim
   and change to the directory 
\verbatim
cd taco-@VERSION@
\endverbatim
-# configuring - 
run
\verbatim
./configure [configure_options]
\endverbatim
-# compiling - 
run
\verbatim
make
\endverbatim 
-# testing - test TACO has correctly compiled 
run
\verbatim
make check 
\endverbatim 
-# installing - install the TACO system
run as root
\verbatim
make install
\endverbatim
-# start TACO - start TACO manager and database : 
\verbatim
taco.startup 
\endverbatim
-# install device - create a device entry in the TACO database 
\verbatim
db_update TEST/mydevice.res 
\endverbatim
-# start device server - position NETHOST and start your device server
\verbatim
export NETHOST=`hostname` 
myds test&
\endverbatim
-# start your client - start your client and test your device server !

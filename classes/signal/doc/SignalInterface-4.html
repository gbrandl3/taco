<H1>2.   Conventions on Signals</H1>
<HR>
 The signal class allows the creation of signal objects with a naming convention as:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 DOMAIN/FAMILY/MEMBER/SIGNAL<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 The signal name is an extension to the device name used in the ESRF control system. To create a signal object a name with four fields must be used. This corresponds to signal naming as it is used in the history database and in general data display applications.<P>
<UL>
<LI>A signal represents a simple data value.<P>
<LI>All signals of a class must be of the same data type.<P>
<LI>The data type might be long values, float values or double values.<P>
</UL>
 A special problem is the relation between read and set values and the command used to change a setpoint. This problem is not yet addressed in this release, but will be addressed in the near future. A fourth command seems to be necessary to send a list of set signals to a device. Also it seems to be necessary to extract from a read signal whether a setpoint is available and what is its name.<P>
 For the SRRF3 project we made only the following convention as a temporary solution:<P>
<UL>
<LI>If the name of the readpoint signal is: <P>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SR/RF-FOC/TRA3-1/Voltage<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the name of the setpoint signal must be:<P>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SR/RF-FOC/TRA3-1/set-Voltage<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>and the command to change the setpoint must be:<P>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
DevSetVoltage<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 With this convention always containing the signal name, the command for the setpoint can be determined.<P>

This directory contains the modules necessary to implement TACO device
servers written in Python. To run these modules the device server libraries
(libdsapi, libdbapi, libdsxdr and libdsxdr_all) must be available as 
shared libraries.

INSTALLATION

The Makefile assumes that the environment variable DSHOME is positioned to
the home directory of the TACO installation i.e. where include and lib
can be found. To make the shared library module simply type linuxmake.

EXAMPLE

Examples of device server classes written in Python and how to startup 
such a device dserver are available in the demo directory.

DOCUMENTATION

Not yet available!

TESTING

To test a device server written in Python, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the
TACO shared libraries. Set NETHOST to your favourite TACO NETHOST.
Load the device definitions to your resource database as commented in
demo/Server_startup.py and run the startup script to create a server of the
class MyServer!

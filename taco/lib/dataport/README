README for the dataport source directory
----------------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for the dataport library.
The dataport library allows uses to create and share data structures
on Unix and OS9 via chareed memory. Synchronisation is achieved
with semaphores.

The files in this directory are :

	Makefile - a GNU make conditional make file for making the
                   dataport library on multiple platforms.

	sema.c - source code for small set of routines which handle
                 the semaphore (under Unix). Basically an interface
		 to semop().

	shared.h - source code for routines which get and release a
		   a shared memory segment (under Unix).

	dataport_ux.c - source code to implement Dataport library
		        under Unix.

	dataport_os.c - source code to implement the Dataport library
	                under OS9.

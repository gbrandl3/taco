This README file describes the directory : lib

This directory contains the source files necessary to implement the device 
server (aka TACO) application programmer's interface (aka DSAPI). 
It is also used as intermediate storage for object files which are created 
during compilation of the DSAPI library files (i.e. not all object files
will have a corresponding source file in this directory).

Description of files and directories found in this directory :

	dev_api.c - source code for the functions which implement the C
		version of DSAPI e.g. dev_import(), dev_putget(), dev_put()

	dev_errors.c - link to the source code file containing the list of
		DS error messages

	dev_states.c - link to the source code file containing the list of
		device states (in ascii)

	gen_api.c - source code for general purpose DSAPI routines for
		printing error, debug and diagnostic messages

	sec_api.c - source code for implementing DSAPI security

	util_api.c - some more DSAPI related routines e.g. dev_put_asyn()

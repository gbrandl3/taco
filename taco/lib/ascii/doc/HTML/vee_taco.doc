Once all these links are made you can follow the instructions in the VeeTest
documentation to call a VeeTest user function. These instructions are
briefly reminded here.

        - excute veetest
        - go to "File" pulldown menu and select "Merge Library ..."
        - find taco_lib.vee (in the directory where you have made the link)
          and click on OK
        - go to "Device" pulldown menu and select "Function --> Call"
        - go to the pulldown menu attached to the window associated with
          this "Call Function" object and select "Select Function".
        - select one of the following functions :
                 dev_get_ascii , dev_put_ascii , dev_putget_ascii
        - You can now attach the input and outputs of the call function object
          you have just created to the appropriate VeeTest objects and then
          execute the veetest program. All the data types (input and output)
          of the three functions above are strings.
          DON'T forget to set the NETHOST variable before executing veetest.

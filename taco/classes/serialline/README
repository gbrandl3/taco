Serialds	The new serial line device server written in C++ and
		accessing the device through the system device 
		descriptors /dev/ttySxxx
		
		source files:		src/Serial.cpp
					src/startup.cpp
					include/Serial.h

		example of use: 	Serialds MP

		example of resources:	dbm_devres mp/serialds/0
						serialline : ttyS0
						charlength : 8
						simulation : 1
						parity : none
						stopbits : 1
						baudrate : 9600
						timeout : 1024


test/octal	specific tool used for testing and configurating the
		Parvus Octal Serial Line PC/104 board.
		  
		source files:		test/octal.c

		generation from src/:	make octal
					make loadoctal

		example of use: 	octal led 0x390
					octal init 0x3a0 5


scripts/Parvus	configuration script which should be called at boot
		time (typically from /etc/rc.d./serial).
		Initializes the Parvus Octal Serial board on your system
		according to the settings defined in file /etc/Parvus.cfg 
		or in the file given as argument.

		This script uses the configuration program called "octal".

		This script uses the environment variable DSHOME to locate
		the files used (variable defined typically in /etc/rc.config).




test/miniterm	usefull tool for testing serial line communications.
		All the characters typed will be sent (including
		control ones) and all the character received are displayed
		without any translation. The serial line settings are:
		9600bauds, 8data bits, no parity, 1stop bit
		  
		source files:		test/miniterm.c

		generation from src/:	make miniterm
					make loadminiterm

		example of use: 	miniterm /dev/ttyS1




test/bridge	tool for testing serial line communications.
		All the characters received or written on a serial line
		will be transmitted to another one.
		The serial line settings are:
		9600bauds, 8data bits, no parity, 1stop bit
		  
		source files:		test/bridge.c

		generation from src/:	make bridge
					make loadbridge

		example of use: 	bridge /dev/ttyS8 /dev/ttyS9



test/bombing	tool for testing serial line communications.
		Comparing a long string written and received on two
		serial lines interconnected through a cable.
		This interconnection can also be done over several
		serial lines using cables and the "bridge" program.
		  
		source files:		test/bombing.c

		generation from src/:	make bombing
					make loadbombing

		example of use: 	bombing /dev/ttyS8 /dev/ttyS9

<h2>Introduction</h2>
TACO is a toolkit for implementing distributed object oriented control systems. It
has been used at the <a href="http://www.esrf.eu">European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://www.esrf.eu})\endlatexonly
 in Grenoble (FRANCE) to control the accelerator complex and all beamlines.

It is also used at
<a href="http://www.frm2.tum.de">Neue Forschungsneutronenquelle "Heinz Maier-Leibnitz" (FRM II)</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://www.frm2.tum.de/})\endlatexonly
in Garching (Germany) to control the instruments and at the
<a href="http://www.hartrao.ac.za">Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO)</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://www.hartrao.ac.za})\endlatexonly
in Hartebeesthoek (South Africa) to control a 26 meter radio telescope.

TACO can be compared to other distributed object toolkits like CORBA, DCOM, and OPC
(on Windows) with the main differences being :

-# TACO is easy to use and understand,
-# TACO is freely available,
-# TACO is based on ONC/RPC (now part of the GNU C library),
-# TACO is multi-platform.

In TACO all control points are represented as devices. Devices are objects which belong
to a control class. The class implements the logic necessary to control the device
hardware/software.

Devices are served by processes called device servers. Device servers are distributed
over one or any number of machines.

Clients which need to accesses devices do so through a application programmer's interface.
The clients can access devices synchronously, asynchronously or by events.

The network layers are kept entirely hidden from the device server and client programmer's by

TACO. TACO supports a database for storing persistant information and keeping track of where
devices are running.

TACO is used to control an accelerator complex, experimental setups on beamlines (using
synchrotron radiation and neutrons), a radio telescope, and other smaller projects.
It is ideal for adding Ethernet control to embedded and non-embedded devices in a research,
industrial or home environment.

Refer to the appendix for a list of existing device servers.

TACO can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://taco.sourceforge.net">TACO website</a>
\latexonly(see {\tt http://taco.sourceforge.net})\endlatexonly
and installed from the source code. TACO is made available under the GNU Public Licence
(see \ref license) without warranties. For news about recent developments in TACO go to the
website.

\n This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several 
sections.

The first part forms a user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref whatis  Provides a brief overview of what TACO is, useful for newcomers to TACO.
<li>Section \ref lite  What is the light version of TACO?
<li>Section \ref install How to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38710&package_id=30925">download</a>, compile and install TACO on your platform 
<li>Section \ref started  For those who wants to get going quickly without having to read this manual.
<li>Section \ref ds_model  DSM
<li>Section \ref c  How to write TACO devices servers in C
<li>Section \ref cplusplus  How to write a TACO device servers in C++
<li>Section \ref basicsteps  How to integrate a new device in my system
<li>Section \ref accesscontrol
<li>Section \ref private_types  How to create new data types.
<li>Section \ref testtool  Testing the running system
<li>Section \ref python_and_taco
<li>Section \ref labview
<li>Section \ref dsapi
<li>Section \ref database_guide
<li>Section \ref events
<li>Section \ref signal
</ul>

The second part forms a reference manual:

<h2> Acknowledgement</h2>
A lot of people have contributed to TACO since its beginning. The following people
have contributed to the kernel of TACO in the form of system programming, bug fixes,
ports etc :

- Martin Diehl (FRM-II) - bug fixes
- Andy G&ouml;tz (ESRF) - device server model, asynchronism, events, dsapi
- Markhu Karhu (ESRF) - (original) ndbm database server
- Wolf-Dieter Klotz (ESRF) - Windows port
- Jens Kr&uuml;ger (FRM-II) - bug fixes
- Jens Meyer (ESRF) - dsapi, dsxdr, security, manager
- Bj&oslash;rn Pedersen (FRM-II) - bug fixes, improvements to events
- Jon Quick (HartRAO) - bug fixes
- Emmanuel Taurel (ESRF) - rtdb, Oracle and ndbm database server, dbapi, hdb

The following people have written client interfaces to TACO :

- Marie-Christine Dominguez (ESRF) - Python clients
- Laurent Farvacque (ESRF) - Mathlab
- Andy G&ouml;tz (ESRF) - Labview
- Jens Meyer (ESRF) - Python servers
- Gilbert Pepellin (ESRF) - Tcl
- Faranguiss Poncet (ESRF) - xdevmenu
- Gerry Swislow (CSS) - SPEC

TACO would not be of much use without the device servers therefore it is only fair
to mention the (long and incomplete) list of device server programmers :

A.Beteva (ESRF), D.Carron (ESRF), J.M.Chaize (ESRF), M-C.Dominguez (ESRF),
F.Epaud (ESRF), L.Farvacque (ESRF), D.Fernandez (ESRF), A.G&ouml;tz (ESRF),

 Installation 

 In order for TACOSilvia to work you must have Qt and a working TACO environment and the Labview-TACO-Lib 
 developed by Andy Götz (see TACO homepage http://www.esrf.fr/taco). 
 
 Step 1:  Building the TACO-Labview-Lib:  
 To build the Taco-Labview-Lib simply execute the Makefile in the labview/server/src/ sub-directory.
 (Don't forget to adapt the correct Labview installation Path in the Makefile)
 
 Step 2:  Building TACOSilvia:  
 To build TACOSiliva ensure that all TACO and Qt environment variables are properly set 
 and simply execute the Makefile in the labview/client/ subdirectory.
 (Don't forget to adapt the correct Labview installation Path in the Makefile)

Build of RPM's
--------------

The builing of the RPM's is a little bit tricky. If you use a SuSE 8.2 distribution
you have to create a file '~/.rpmmacros' which contains the follwing contents.

%_prefix 	/usr/local/dshome
%_infodir       %{_prefix}/info
%_sysconfdir	%{_prefix}/etc

These definitions define some pathes used during the building and installation of the
RPM's. These macros point per default to other directories so the RPM could not build
successfully.

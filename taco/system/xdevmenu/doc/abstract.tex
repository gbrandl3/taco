This document is intended for the users of xdevmenu and 
includes on a user point of view all the information associated with "xdevmenu"
application developed in the computing services. This guide is in fact a
set of two documents. The first one is an
overview of the application giving a general insight into the use of 
the program and the second one is more specifically the user's guide where an 
example illustrates the options the user can have during a session.

This document includes all the information associated with the "xdevmenu"
application developed in the computing services. This document is in fact a
set of three documents which could be used separately. The first one is a
general overview of the application. The second one is the software
documentation, which is to be used by the software developer who
wants to modify or simply to know about the code of the application. The third
document is the user's guide.

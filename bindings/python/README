			TACO - Python interface (client)
			===============================

Attention: 
	The class names has changed from "dev" to "TacoDevice"!!!

This version contains less memory leaks, a lot of bugs repaired, and
some cleaned up source code. The functionality is the same as the first

This directory contains the modules necessary to implement TACO device
servers written in Python. To run these modules the device server libraries
(libdsapinomain, libdbapi, libdcapi and libdsxdr_all) must be available as 
shared libraries.

EXAMPLE

Examples of device server classes written in Python and how to startup 
such a device dserver are available in the 'demo' directory.

TESTING

To test a device server written in Python, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the
TACO shared libraries. Set NETHOST to your favourite TACO NETHOST. Set the PYTHONPATH
to point also to the TACO python bindings. 
Load the device definitions to your resource database as commented in
demo/Server_startup.py and run the startup script to create a server of the
class MyServer!
